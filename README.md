<div>NFT? ERC-721 tokens?</div>

NFT stands for non-fungible tokens like ERC-721 (a smart contract standard) tokens which are hosted on Ethereumâ€™s own blockchain. NFTs are unique digital items such as collectibles or artworks or game items. As an artist, by tokenizing your work you both ensure that it is unique and brand it as your work. The actual ownership is blockchain-managed.
